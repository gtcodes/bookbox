# Bookbox
This repository is for the bookbox notification system.
In the bookbox there is (or will be) a microcontroller (adafruit feather huzzah based on esp8266) that is connected to the wifi. This will, once a day, measure the amount of books in the box and report it to the webserver running on the network. 
The webserver will send an email to joker@gtg.se to notify them to empty the box.
